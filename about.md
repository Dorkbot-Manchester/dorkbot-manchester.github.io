First there was [dorkbotnyc](http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotnyc/about.shtml) in 2001, a monthly meeting of electronic artists in New York:

> "dorkbotnyc is a monthly meeting of artists (sound / image / movement / whatever), designers, engineers, students and other interested parties from the new york area who are involved in the creation of electronic art (in the broadest sense of the term.)"

Then there was [Dorkbot Manchester #1](/1) - [#3](/3) in 2007 & 2008. Then it all went a bit quiet until [Dorkbot Manchester #4](/4) in 2023. Now we're back! 

If you're not in Manchester, UK then why not see if there is a [dorkbot near you](http://dorkbot.org)?
