First there was [dorkbotnyc](http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotnyc/about.shtml), a monthly meeting of electronic artists in new york:

> "dorkbotnyc is a monthly meeting of artists (sound / image / movement / whatever), designers, engineers, students and other interested parties from the new york area who are involved in the creation of electronic art (in the broadest sense of the term.)"

We felt like the North West of England could do with the same! 

If you're not in Manchester, UK then why not see if there is a [dorkbot near you](http://dorkbot.org)?  They're springing up everywhere...
