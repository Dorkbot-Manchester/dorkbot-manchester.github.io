Confirmed so far is James Brown currently showing at Site gallery, And  we hope
that Lewis Sykes of Sancho plan will be presenting.

> “James Brown builds partial film sets in Galleries of superficially domestic
scenes. Each set is fabricated to allow various forms of kinetic sequences to be
staged for camera (such as a bottle of milk falling over, plaster dust falling
from around a light fixture, a pen rolling off a table, a television losing its
signal etc.) these actions approximate cliché scenarios of imminent disaster as
fictionalised in popular culture; specifically in Disaster genre film such as
The Poseidon Adventure Earthquake Towering Inferno, and Jurassic Park.”
