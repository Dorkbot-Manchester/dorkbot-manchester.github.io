SAVE THE DATE! Dorkbot Manchester #9 will be happening on Wednesday, March 18th!

Full lineup coming soon. If you’ve got a project you’d like to talk about, show, or demo on the night with a friendly audience of arty dorks and dorky artists, let us know! You can take a look at our [previous events](/events) to get an idea of the kinds of things you'll see on the night.

5 minute Open Dork slots are also available.

Looking forward to seeing you all!
