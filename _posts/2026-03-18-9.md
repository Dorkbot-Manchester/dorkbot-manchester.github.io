Book free tickets <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/1983376043136">on Eventbrite</a>.

SAVE THE DATE! Dorkbot Manchester #9 will be happening on Wednesday, March 18th! Booking a ticket isn't essential, but it helps us and SODA get an idea of how many people to expect.

Full lineup coming soon. If you’ve got a project you’d like to talk about, show, or demo on the night with a friendly audience of arty dorks and dorky artists, let us know! You can take a look at our [previous events](/events) to get an idea of the kinds of things you'll see on the night.

5 minute Open Dork slots are also available for anyone to talk about anything!

We'd also like to ask if you have any ideas for talks or demos that you'd like to see from other people. We've already got a few things lined up, but we thought it'd be fun to put it out to you, the friends of Dorkbot, and ask if there's anybody you'd particularly like to see. This could be someone you know personally, or just someone whose work you'd admire and you'd like to hear more from. Our sweet spot is people whose work simultaneously tickles the arty right side and techy left side of your brain.

Send us your ideas by email to dorkbotmcr@gmail.com or Insta DMs to [@dorkbotmcr](https://www.instagram.com/dorkbotmcr/) 🙌

Looking forward to seeing you all!
