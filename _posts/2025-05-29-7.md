SAVE THE DATE! Dorkbot Manchester #7 will be happening on Thursday, May 29th!

Full lineup coming soon. If you’ve got a project you’d like to talk about, show, or demo on the night with a friendly audience of arty dorks and dorky artists, let us know!

5 minute Open Dork slots are also available.

We’re not in our usual home at SODA this time - we’ll be round the corner in the Grosvenor East building, on Cavendish Street and Oxford Road.

Looking forward to seeing you all!

If you'd like to talk or show a project, let us know: <a href="mailto:dorkbotmcr@gmail.com">dorkbotmcr@gmail.com</a>.
